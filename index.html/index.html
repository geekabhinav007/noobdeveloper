                    <h2 class="h-secondary center">Programming</h2>
                    <p class="center"> Computer programming is the process of designing
                         and building an executable computer program to accomplish a
                          specific computing result or to perform a specific task.
                           Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating 
                           algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource 
                           consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a 
                           chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding)
                           .[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or 
                           more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather
                            than machine code, which is directly executed by the central 
                            processing unitTasks accompanying and related to programming
                             include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
                              implementation of build systems, and management of 
                              derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
                               programs. These might be considered part of the programming
                                process, but often the term software development is used
                                 for this larger process with the term programming, 
                                 implementation, or coding reserved for the actual 
                                 writing of code. Software engineering combines
                                  engineering techniques with software development
                                   practices. Reverse engineering is a related process
                                    used by designers, analysts and programmers to
                                     understand and re-create/re-implement.[3]:3</p>

                        <p class="center"> Welcome! Are you completely new to
                             programming? If not then we presume you will be
                              looking for information about why and how to get
                               started with Python. Fortunately an experienced
                                programmer in any programming language
                                 (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly.
                                  It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, 
                                  so jump in!

                            Installing
                            Installing Python is generally
                             easy, and nowadays many Linux and 
                             UNIX distributions include a recent Python.
                             Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP)
                              now come with Python already installed. If you do 
                              need to install Python and aren't confident about 
                              the task you can find a few notes on the 
                              BeginnersGuide/Download wiki page, but installation
                               is unremarkable on most platforms.
                            
                            Learning
                            Before getting started, you may want 
                            to find out which IDEs and text editors are
                             tailored to make Python editing easy, browse
                              the list of introductory books, or look at code
                               samples that you might find helpful.
